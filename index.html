        <p>My name is Cameron Braunstein, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany. 
          I am supervised by <a href="https://cvmp.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/#eddy-ilg">Eddy Ilg</a> and <a href="https://mtoneva.com/">Mariya Toneva</a>, 
          as a member of the first cohort of the Research Training Group <a href="https://www.neuroexplicit.org/">Neuroexplicit Models of Language, Vision, and Action</a>. 
          My goal is to develop explainable vision‑language AI models which are well aligned with human cognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to my PhD, I recieved my Master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from Saarland University in 2023. The research from
          my Master's thesis, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16118">Quantum-Hybrid Stereo Matching With Nonlinear Regularization and Spatial Pyramids</a>
          was published at the <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2024/">International Conference on 3D Vision 2024</a>. 
          I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about tutoring and contributing to my academic community. I have been a teaching assistant for numerous courses. 
          In addition to my Master's thesis, I delivered a talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE8QXn4AbIw">Quantum Computing</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. 
          I am currently serving as a PhD student representative for my Research Training Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy classical piano, chess, and studying mathematics. You can find my full CV <a href="documents/CameronBraunsteinCV.pdf" download>here</a>.
